- ðŸ‘‹ Hi,I am Mustafa Essam,
 passionate about technology and I love programming since high school.
 I continuously improve myself throughout the university.
 I love to explore and learn new facts.
 Programming and data analysis helped me to explore the world
, whether from important issues such as climate change,
 which prompted me to enter the geography department and study those materials related to the environment
. I love numbers and make data an easy story. 
List it to everyone I shared with a wonderful group of people in the workplace and we were analyzing how the world could change for the better
. My message is how to make our reality better.
